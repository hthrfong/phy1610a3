Profiling Report

I have included two log reports because I did the first half of the assignment on my laptop, and then realized that I could not use gprof unless I was on SciNet. I made a new git log file while working on SciNet, and then decided it would be a better idea if I stuck with one repository instead of two. Therefore, I git cloned the repository originally on my laptop over to SciNet and continued working from there. However, the SciNet git log from before I git cloned the repository has been submitted for completeness. The log file is called "scinet_log.log".

For modularized code, the bottleneck is at time_step_ant.cpp,
    between each time step: 0.0257 s
    during time_step_ant: 0.0227 s
    between each time step (for loop): 0.0177 s
    during time_step_ant (for loop):  0.0149 s
Here, "for loop" means that I don't call time_step_ant.h, and instead, I simply copy and paste the time_step_ant.cpp code into driver.cpp.
It seems that its performance is improved when I do not call the module. From the profiling output, it seems to spend the bulk of its time calling the various rarray<float,2>. As a result, when the for loop is used instead of the module, it is faster because the code doesn't need to call each rarray<float,2>.

For original code, the bottleneck occurs at the same equivalent steps as the modularlized code.
    between each time step: 0.0169 s
    during time step stage: 0.0164 s

To do the profiling, I ran "make" in their respective folders. This compiles the code and generates an "output.txt" file that shows the profiling.
